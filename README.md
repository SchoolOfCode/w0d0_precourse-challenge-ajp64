*<h2>Why I chose Satoru Iwata as the subject</h2>*
Just recently, I finished reading the book [Ask Iwata](http://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54736620-ask-iwata) which is composed of a collection of stories
and insights from Satoru Iwata, the former CEO of Nintendo. He was know as a highly influencial and impactful person in the field of game development, largely due
to his ability to solve programming challenges, particularly in the early days of the industry. I thought this made him the perfect focus for this project!


*<h2>What I learned</h2>*
* **Plan ahead with CSS**

When adding CSS, my approach was a bit random, in the sense that I was just making changes to different parts of the website without keeping good track of 
where these changes were made in the CSS. For example, I had a 'figcaption' with the ID 'img-caption', and I had CSS for both figcaption{} and #img-caption{} without 
realising it. This lead to issues where changes I was making didn't seem to be taking effect until I realised they were being overruled by CSS elsewhere.

* **Find better colour contrasts**

I wanted a background which had a gaming element to it, so I used a tiled image of various gameboys. However I don't think I was able to effectively add the page content 
over top of this. In the future I would try to establish effective colour contrasts and fonts early on, rather than at the end when all the pieces are in place.

*<h2>Reflections</h2>*
* **Follow the user story, and then focus on extras**

I was thinking about potential design elements before completing the user story. Once all the neccesary user story requests are in place, then it would make more sense
after that to focus more on presentation and design. The user story lends itself to what the website should look like in the end, so too much focus on design elements beforehand
might not be ideal.

* **Finding a balance of simple and effective**

Although my background is quite busy, I wanted the actual content of the website to be simple, easy to read text. However it might be too simple, to the point of looking uninteresting.
I probably should have added some <asides> to break it up and make it more visually interesting, with information in different places.
